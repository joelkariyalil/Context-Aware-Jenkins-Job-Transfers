# Welcome to Context Aware Jenkins Job Transfers Documentation

**Context Aware Jenkins Job Transfers** provides a pythonic way of transferring jobs between two Jenkins Servers. It is essentially a Python wrapper for the Jenkins REST API, allowing users to transfer jobs along with their associated views and plugins, resulting in a **Context Aware Jenkins Job Transfer**.

## Comparison with Other Jenkins Transfer Tools

The current available methods of moving jobs among Jenkins servers are described [here](https://medium.com/@rajinikanthvadla9/jenkins-moving-from-one-server-to-another-server-methods-39437733b1e0).

| **Feature**                | **Context Aware Jenkins Job Transfers**                                                | **Other Jenkins Transfer Tools**                           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Job Transfer**            | Seamless transfer of jobs between Jenkins servers with associated views and plugins.    | Basic job transfer functionality; often lacks comprehensive job context. |
| **View Transfer**           | Transfers views (all jobs in views) in a single operation.                                    | No support for transferring views |
| **Plugin Dependency Check** | Automatically checks for plugin dependencies and resolves them during the transfer.     | No support for checking plugin dependencies          |
| **Terminal Visualization**  | Full visualization of transfer steps in the terminal for better user interaction.       | Often lacks terminal-level feedback or logging.             |
| **Python Integration**      | Written in Python for easy integration with other Python projects.                      | Often script-heavy or requires additional configuration files. |
| **Workflow Scope**          | Allows workflows to be built pythonically, leveraging Python tools.                     | Often script-heavy, requiring more configuration.           |
